Installation
============


This guide is intended for people who are not currently using Anaconda. If you
already have a Python 3 conda environment, skip below to the
subsection :ref:`installingsoftware`.

Create a Conda Environment
--------------------------

You first need to get the Anaconda module and enter a custom
environment.

.. code:: bash

   module load anaconda3

Either enter your preferred conda environment with
``source activate YOUR_ENV_NAME`` if you already have one, or create a
new one. I call my power spectrum conda environment ``ps``, but you can
name it something else if you want, just replace every mention of ``ps``
in the instructions below with your desired environment name.

.. code:: bash

   conda create -n ps python=3

Enter your environment. This is what you will type every time you want
to compute some spectra (and in your SLURM power spectrum jobs!).

.. code:: bash

  conda activate ps

You will need to install some other necessary packages into your conda
environment, if you just created it. Note that we are using ``-n`` to
specify the conda environment!

.. code:: bash

  conda install -n ps matplotlib cython numpy scipy astropy pillow

If you are running on a machine with Jupyter like cori or niagara, we
also set up ipykernel so your conda environment shows up in Jupyter. You
can do this on tiger too, but itâ€™s less convenient (see `Jupyter on the
Cluster`_).

.. code:: bash

  conda install -n ps ipykernel
  python -m ipykernel install --user \
     --name ps --display-name "Python 3 (ps)"

Installing Software
-------------------

We now install the power spectrum software. Install NaMaster with

.. code:: bash

  conda install -c conda-forge namaster -n ps

You also need to install pixell for CAR map manipulation. This involves cloning
a GitHub repository, so for convenience you might want to `set up your SSH keys
on GitHub`_. If you are on niagara, you will also need to
``module load autotools`` to get autoconf
before installing pixell. Go to the directory where you keep your software, and
run

.. code:: bash

  git clone git@github.com:simonsobs/pixell.git
  cd pixell
  python setup.py install --user

You also need `healpy` to manipulate healpix maps.

.. code:: bash

    pip install healpy

Then install nawrapper (these routines for ACT power spectrum analysis). Return to
the directory where you keep your software, and then run

.. code:: bash

  git clone git@github.com:xzackli/nawrapper.git
  cd nawrapper
  pip install -e . --user

You should be all set! Try out the :ref:`quickstart`.



Updating NaWrapper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To get new version of NaWrapper in the future, you'll have to run `git pull` in
the `nawrapper` repository you had cloned earlier. Since you installed with `-e`
using pip, this is all you have to do.
