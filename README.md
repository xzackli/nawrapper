# nawrapper

`nawrapper` is a thin wrapper around [NaMaster](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/NaMaster)
for CMB work, particularly for the ACT experiment. The intention is to hide some of NaMaster's generality for conciseness and simplicity.

Read the [documentation](http://physics.princeton.edu/~zequnl/nawrapper/index.html).

## Installation

This package requires numpy, scipy, astropy, pillow, as well as pixell and NaMaster.

The documentation has detailed [installation instructions](http://physics.princeton.edu/~zequnl/nawrapper/usage/installation.html)
which have been tested on the tiger and niagara clusters.
